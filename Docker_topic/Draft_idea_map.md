6. **Managing Multi-Container Apps** (Dependency management, Service naming, Restart policies)
7. **Environment Variables and Configuration** (`ENV`, `.env` files, Configs in Compose)
8. **Docker Logging and Monitoring** (`docker logs`, Logging drivers, Basics of Monitoring)
9. **Docker Container Lifecycle Management** (`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `pause`, `unpause`, `rm`)
10. **Understanding Docker Storage Drivers** (Overlay2, AUFS, Devicemapper, etc.)

**Level: Advanced (Optimization, Security, and Orchestration)**

1. **Docker Image Optimization** (Multi-stage Builds, Minimizing Layers, Alpine Linux)
2. **Docker Security Best Practices** (Non-root Users, Image Scanning, `docker scan`, Secrets Management)
3. **Resource Limitation and Allocation** (`--cpus`, `--memory`, `resources` in Compose)
4. **Docker Swarm Introduction** (Orchestration Basics, Nodes, Services, Tasks, Replicas)
5. **Deploying Stacks with Docker Swarm** (`docker stack deploy`, Compose file version 3)
6. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing** (Swarm's built-in LB, VIP, DNSRR)
7. **Health Checks and Self-healing** (`HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile, `healthcheck` in Compose)
8. **Docker with CI/CD Pipelines** (Integration with Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
9. **Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm** (When to use which, Orchestration Comparison)
10. **Docker Internals and Namespaces** (Namespaces, Cgroups, UnionFS, deeper dive into architecture)

**Level: Expert (Deep Dive, Customization, and Enterprise Features)**

1. **Custom Docker Image Registries** (Setup private registry with Harbor, Nexus, or Docker Registry)
2. **Advanced Docker Networking** (Calico, Cilium, Configuring MTU, Multiple Networks)
3. **Docker Storage Deep Dive** (CSI, Storage Plugins, Cloud Storage Integrations)
4. **Building Docker Plugins** (Volume, Network Plugins, Use cases)
5. **Monitoring Docker with Prometheus and Grafana** (Metrics Collection, Visualization)
6. **Implementing Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)** (UCP, DTR, LDAP/AD Integration)
7. **Docker and GitOps** (Flux, Argo CD, Continuous Deployment Strategies)
8. **Docker for Serverless Applications** (Docker OpenFaas, Fn Project)
9. **Customizing Docker Daemon** (`daemon.json`, Experimental Features, Performance Tweaks)
10. **Docker Community and Contribution** (How to contribute, Engaging with Docker Community)

**Level: Specialization Tracks**

* **DevOps with Docker**:
        + Docker in Agile Development
        + Docker for Dev/Test Environments
        + Docker 101 for Ops Teams
* **Cloud Native with Docker**:
        + Docker on AWS ECS/EC2
        + Docker on Azure ACI/AKS
        + Docker on Google Cloud Run/GKE
* **Security Specialization**:
        + Docker Bench and Security Audits
        + Notary and Content Trust
        + Securing Docker Registries
* **Performance Engineering**:
        + Docker Performance Benchmarking
        + Tuning Docker for Bare Metal
        + Kernel Tuning for Docker Workloads

This roadmap takes you from not knowing what Docker is, all the way to being able to architect and manage Docker environments like a pro, including security, performance, and enterprise-level features. Happy learning!
