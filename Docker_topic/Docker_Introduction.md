# Introduction to Containerization

Containerization is an OS-level virtualization method for deploying and running distributed applications without launching an entire VM for each application. Instead, multiple isolated systems (containers) run on a single control host with access to the OS kernel.

## Evolution of Containerization

- **2000s**: Early Linux container technologies (chroot, Linux VServer, OpenVZ)
- **2008**: LXC (Linux Containers) introduced as first complete implementation
- **2013**: Docker revolutionized the approach with improved tooling and usability

## Core Principles

- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments
- **Portability**: Consistent behavior across different environments
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to traditional virtualization
- **Immutability**: Containers are typically immutable and stateless by design

# What is Docker?

## History

Docker was created by Solomon Hykes as an internal project at dotCloud (a PaaS company) in 2013. Initially built on LXC, Docker later developed its own container runtime called libcontainer.

**Key milestones**:
- **March 2013**: Released as open-source project
- **2014**: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM announced support
- **2015**: Docker, Inc. contributed container format and runtime to Open Container Initiative (OCI)
- **2017**: Introduced Moby Project for open component collaboration

## Docker Basics

### Core Components

1. **Docker Engine**: Core container runtime and orchestration technology
   - Docker daemon (dockerd)
   - REST API
   - Command-line interface (CLI)

2. **Docker Images**: Read-only templates containing:
   - Base OS layer
   - Application code
   - Dependencies
   - Configuration

3. **Containers**: Running instances of images with:
   - Isolated process space
   - Isolated networking
   - Isolated filesystem

4. **Docker Registry**: Repository for storing and distributing images
   - Docker Hub (public registry)
   - Private registries

                        │Docker Registry  │
                        │  (Docker Hub)   │
                        └─────────────────┘
```

### Key Workflow

1. Define application in `Dockerfile`
2. Build image with `docker build`
3. Push to registry with `docker push`
4. Pull and run with `docker run`

## Importance of Docker

### Technical Advantages

- **Consistent Environment**: "Works on my machine" problem eliminated
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shares OS kernel, minimal overhead
- **Isolation**: Better security and dependency management
- **Rapid Deployment**: Seconds to start versus minutes for VMs
- **Version Control**: Images are versioned and immutable

### Industry Impact

- **DevOps Enabler**: Bridged development and operations
- **Microservices Architecture**: Facilitated decomposition of monoliths
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Streamlined testing and deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Containerization as declarative approach
- **Cloud-Native Development**: Foundation for Kubernetes and cloud platforms

Docker fundamentally transformed software delivery by standardizing the container format and providing tooling that made containers accessible to average developers, not just infrastructure specialists.
