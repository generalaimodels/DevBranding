## 1. What is UI Testing?

UI Testing is a type of software testing that verifies the visual elements and interactions of an application’s user interface. It ensures that the UI behaves correctly, is intuitive, and meets both functional and non-functional requirements. UI Testing encompasses the validation of buttons, forms, menus, navigation, text, images, and other interface components, ensuring they work as intended and provide a seamless user experience.

### Key Objectives of UI Testing
- Validate that the UI matches the design specifications (e.g., wireframes, mockups).
- Ensure all UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, dropdowns) function correctly.
- Verify the UI is responsive and consistent across different devices, screen sizes, and browsers.
- Confirm the UI adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
- Ensure the UI provides a positive user experience (e.g., intuitive navigation, clear error messages).

### UI Testing in the SDLC
UI Testing is typically performed during the integration and system testing phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It is often conducted after unit and integration testing but before user acceptance testing (UAT). UI Testing can be manual, automated, or a combination of both, depending on the project requirements.
