## 1. What is Functional Testing?

Functional testing is a type of software testing that validates the functionality of an application by verifying that it works as per the specified requirements. It focuses on testing the system's features and operational behavior without concern for the internal code structure or implementation details. The primary goal is to ensure that the software delivers the expected output for a given input, adhering to the business and user requirements.

### Key Characteristics of Functional Testing
- **Black-Box Testing Approach**: Testers focus on inputs and outputs without knowledge of the internal code or logic.
- **Requirement-Driven**: Tests are designed based on functional specifications, user stories, or use cases.
- **End-User Perspective**: It simulates real-world usage to ensure the application meets user expectations.
- **Feature Validation**: Each feature or function of the application is tested individually or in combination.

## 2. Importance of Functional Testing

Functional testing is indispensable in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) for the following reasons:

- **Ensures Requirement Compliance**: Validates that the application meets the business and functional requirements.
- **Improves User Experience**: Ensures that the application is user-friendly and behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
- **Reduces Business Risks**: Identifies defects early, preventing costly fixes in production.
- **Supports Quality Assurance**: Acts as a quality gate before releasing the software to end users.
- **Facilitates Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that the software adheres to industry standards or legal requirements, if applicable.

## 9. Functional Testing vs. Non-Functional Testing

To provide a holistic understanding, it’s important to differentiate functional testing from non-functional testing:

| **Aspect**           | **Functional Testing**                     | **Non-Functional Testing**               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**            | Validates "what" the system does.          | Validates "how" the system performs.     |
| **Examples**         | Unit, integration, system, UAT.            | Performance, security, usability testing.|
| **Objective**        | Ensure features work as per requirements.  | Ensure system quality attributes (e.g., speed, reliability). |
| **Tools**            | Selenium, Postman, TestComplete.           | JMeter, LoadRunner, OWASP ZAP.           |

## 10. Example of Functional Testing

To solidify the concept, let’s consider a practical example of functional testing for an e-commerce application:

### Scenario: User Login Functionality
- **Requirement**: The system should allow registered users to log in with valid credentials and display an error message for invalid credentials.

### Test Cases:
1. **Positive Test Case**:
   - **Input**: Valid username and password.
   - **Expected Output**: User is logged in and redirected to the homepage.
2. **Negative Test Case**:
   - **Input**: Invalid username or password.
   - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Invalid credentials. Please try again."
3. **Boundary Test Case**:
   - **Input**: Username and password at the maximum character limit.
   - **Expected Output**: User is logged in successfully or an appropriate error message is displayed.
4. **Integration Test Case**:
   - **Input**: Valid credentials, followed by accessing the user profile.
   - **Expected Output**: Profile data is fetched and displayed correctly.

### Tools Used:
- Selenium for automating browser-based login tests.
- Postman for testing the login API (if applicable).
- JIRA for defect tracking.
